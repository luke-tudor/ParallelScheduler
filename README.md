# ParallelScheduler

## How To Run
Download .jar file from releases, open a terminal window in that directory, type "java -jar scheduler.jar $name-of-input-graph$ $number-of-processors$ $other-arguments$". The other arguments can be any order of "-v" for visualisation, "-o $output-file-name$", and "-N $number-of-threads-to-use$".

## Design Strategy
Agile development methods of fast iteration with a focus on the MVP through every step of the way. The priority has been the algorithm, only once the algorithm was producing an optimal schedule for every input was visualisation worked on. The visualisation and algorithm optimisation have been worked on seperately, as they were tasks easily dividable. 

## Task Allocation
Eleventh hour has revolved around the work of Luke Tudor, as represented by the sheer amount of his commits. He created the data structures and the main algorithm, together with Andrew Lyall has improved the efficiency and performance of the running of it. Andrew has been working closely with Luke, and has been the project manager, organising meetings and designating tasks. Andrew has also taken up the role of primary tester, and has written all the unit tests for this project. Nathan Gavin has been the primary visualisation dev, and enlisted the help of Warren Yeu in doing so. Max van Duin has focused on documenting the code, and has aided both Luke during the initial algorithm creation stage, and Nathan while creating the visualisation.
